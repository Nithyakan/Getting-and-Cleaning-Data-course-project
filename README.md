# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-course-project
This repo contains my project work for “Getting and Cleaning Data” course with the following files:

  1.	My script for performing the analysis named run_analysis.R (contains R code for the project. Steps performed using this code include:
    *	Read in the data.
    *	Perform various transformations such as merging datasets, subsetting data frame to extract only columns that calculate mean    and standard deviation, selecting required columns, renaming variables, ordering & summarizing to get average or mean of each variable by subject-activity pair to finally yield a tidy dataset.
    *	Writing the data frame to text file called ‘finalfile.txt’.
  2.	A code book named CodeBook.md that describes the dataset given, the variables considered for analyses and transformations performed to clean up the data by using the R code in the run_analysis.R script.
